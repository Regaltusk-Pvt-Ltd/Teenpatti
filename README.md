This is an Android app game of classical Indian Teenpatti. For now, it is a single player game of 5 players which includes 1 human player and 4 CPU bots. Game is played by standard Teenpatti rules.

App is a little weak on the UI part and I am currently working on the issue. Also chances of coming across bugs are also there while playing and if you do, do report it to me.

Note: Uploaded files doesn't include executable and binary files. So, it would be preferable to download only source code instead of downloading entire file system.

That's all. Happy Gaming!
